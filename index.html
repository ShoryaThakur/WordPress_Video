        management system. It was originally created as a tool to publish blogs
        but has evolved to support publishing other web content, including more
        traditional websites, mailing lists and Internet forum, media galleries,
        membership sites, learning management systems and online stores.

        popular content management systems. It was used by 42.8% of the top 10
        million websites as of October 2021.
